@deftypefun void jit_init (void)
This is normally the first function that you call when using
@code{libjit}.  It initializes the library and prepares for
JIT operations.

The @code{jit_context_create} function also calls this, so you can
avoid using @code{jit_init} if @code{jit_context_create} is the first
JIT function that you use.

It is safe to initialize the JIT multiple times.  Subsequent
initializations are quietly ignored.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int jit_uses_interpreter (void)
Determine if the JIT uses a fall-back interpreter to execute code
rather than generating and executing native code.  This can be
called prior to @code{jit_init}.
