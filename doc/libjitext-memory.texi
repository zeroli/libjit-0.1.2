@cindex Memory operations

The following functions are provided to set, copy, compare, and search
memory blocks.

@deftypefun {void *} jit_memset (void *@var{dest}, int @var{ch}, unsigned int @var{len})
Set the @var{len} bytes at @var{dest} to the value @var{ch}.
Returns @var{dest}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {void *} jit_memcpy (void *@var{dest}, const void *@var{src}, unsigned int @var{len})
Copy the @var{len} bytes at @var{src} to @var{dest}.  Returns
@var{dest}.  The behavior is undefined if the blocks overlap
(use @var{jit_memmove} instead for that case).
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {void *} jit_memmove (void *@var{dest}, const void *@var{src}, unsigned int @var{len})
Copy the @var{len} bytes at @var{src} to @var{dest} and handle
overlapping blocks correctly.  Returns @var{dest}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int jit_memcmp (const void *@var{s1}, const void *@var{s2}, unsigned int @var{len})
Compare @var{len} bytes at @var{s1} and @var{s2}, returning a negative,
zero, or positive result depending upon their relationship.  It is
system-specific as to whether this function uses signed or unsigned
byte comparisons.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {void *} jit_memchr (void *@var{str}, int @var{ch}, unsigned int @var{len})
Search the @var{len} bytes at @var{str} for the first instance of
the value @var{ch}.  Returns the location of @var{ch} if it was found,
or NULL if it was not found.
@end deftypefun
